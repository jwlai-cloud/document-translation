# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a multimodal document translation application that preserves the original layout and formatting of rich documents (PDF, DOCX, EPUB) while translating text content. Unlike conventional translation apps that simply extract and translate text via OCR, this application maintains visual elements like icons, images, and formatting while intelligently replacing translated content and adjusting layout when translated text differs in length from the original.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload rich format documents (PDF, DOCX, EPUB) for translation, so that I can translate documents while preserving their visual layout and formatting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a document THEN the system SHALL accept PDF, DOCX, and EPUB file formats
2. WHEN a document is uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate the file format and size constraints
3. IF an invalid file format is uploaded THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN a valid document is uploaded THEN the system SHALL store it temporarily for processing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically detect the primary language of my document, so that I don't have to manually specify the source language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is processed THEN the system SHALL analyze the text content to identify the primary language
2. WHEN language detection is complete THEN the system SHALL display the detected language to the user
3. IF the language detection confidence is low THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to confirm or correct the detected language
4. WHEN multiple languages are detected THEN the system SHALL identify the predominant language as primary

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select a target language for translation, so that I can translate my document to my desired language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the source language is detected THEN the system SHALL present a list of available target languages
2. WHEN displaying language options THEN the system SHALL support popular languages including English, French, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, and Korean
3. WHEN a user selects a target language THEN the system SHALL validate the language pair is supported
4. IF an unsupported language pair is selected THEN the system SHALL notify the user and suggest alternatives
5. WHEN a valid target language is selected THEN the system SHALL proceed with translation preparation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to preserve the original document layout including images and icons during translation, so that the translated document maintains its visual appeal and structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a document THEN the system SHALL identify and preserve all visual elements (images, icons, charts, tables)
2. WHEN translating text THEN the system SHALL maintain the spatial relationship between text and visual elements
3. WHEN translated text is longer than original THEN the system SHALL intelligently adjust layout to accommodate the new text length
4. WHEN translated text is shorter than original THEN the system SHALL maintain proper spacing and alignment
5. WHEN text overlaps with visual elements THEN the system SHALL adjust positioning to prevent conflicts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to preview both the original and translated versions of my document side by side, so that I can review the translation quality and layout preservation before finalizing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN translation is complete THEN the system SHALL display a side-by-side preview of original and translated documents
2. WHEN viewing the preview THEN the system SHALL allow zooming and scrolling for detailed inspection
3. WHEN in preview mode THEN the system SHALL highlight translated text areas for easy identification
4. WHEN reviewing the preview THEN the system SHALL allow users to navigate between document pages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to download the translated document in the same format as the original, so that I can use it in my existing workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests download THEN the system SHALL generate the translated document in the original format (PDF, DOCX, or EPUB)
2. WHEN generating the download THEN the system SHALL preserve all formatting, fonts, and visual elements
3. WHEN download is ready THEN the system SHALL provide a secure download link with appropriate filename
4. WHEN download is complete THEN the system SHALL clean up temporary files after a reasonable time period

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want a quality check mechanism to verify translation accuracy, so that I can ensure the translated content meets my standards before using it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN translation is complete THEN the system SHALL perform automated quality checks on the translated content
2. WHEN quality issues are detected THEN the system SHALL highlight problematic areas in the preview
3. WHEN displaying quality results THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores for different sections
4. IF translation quality falls below threshold THEN the system SHALL suggest manual review or retranslation
5. WHEN quality check is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a quality report with metrics and recommendations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle various document complexities gracefully, so that I can translate documents with different layouts and content types reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing documents with tables THEN the system SHALL preserve table structure and translate cell content appropriately
2. WHEN processing documents with headers and footers THEN the system SHALL maintain their positioning and translate content
3. WHEN processing documents with text boxes THEN the system SHALL preserve box boundaries and adjust text fitting
4. WHEN processing documents with multi-column layouts THEN the system SHALL maintain column structure during translation
5. IF document processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options
